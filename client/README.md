# collaborative-minds

This is the client side of the project.
The client side runs using the "Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework" AngularJS. 
For styling, Twitter's Bootstrap 3.0.2 is used. 

All references are embedded in the <head> of the **index.html** page. 

To run the application simply make sure that the collaborative-minds folder is copied as a child of ~/Sites, and then browse to http://localhost/collaborative-minds/client/

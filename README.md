# collaborative-minds

This is a personal project which aims to be recreating some of [Trello](https://trello.com/)'s basic functionality using the following new (for me) technologies:

- Google's [Angular.JS](http://angularjs.org/) for the front end
- [Express.JS](http://expressjs.com/) and [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) on the server side
- [Neo4J](http://www.neo4j.org/) (graph database) as permanent data storage

The ultimate goal for this project is, personally, to get my hands dirty with these technologies which are still uncharted territory for me. Any help therefore is much appreciated (i.e. pull requests are welcome!)

The overall project structure is inspired by [https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app](https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app) and by [http://briantford.com/blog/huuuuuge-angular-apps.html](http://briantford.com/blog/huuuuuge-angular-apps.html).

To run this (on a Mac) copy the **collaborative-minds** folder in your **Sites** folder. Then browse to [http://localhost/collaborative-minds/client](http://localhost/collaborative-minds/client). For more info, please refer to the **README.md** files within the **client** and the **server** folders respectively
